        <div class="col-md-3"><h5>Hopping:</h5>Rabbits are famous for their distinctive hopping gait, which allows them to move quickly and efficiently across various terrains. Their powerful hind legs are adapted for jumping and running to evade predators.</div>
        <div class="col-md-3"><h5>Teeth:</h5>Rabbits are known for their continuously growing teeth. To prevent overgrowth, they must constantly gnaw on fibrous vegetation, hay, and chew toys. Their teeth have enamel only on the front, which wears down unevenly, leading to the need for constant chewing.</div>
        <div class="col-md-3"><h5>Vision and Hearing:</h5> Rabbits have excellent vision, with a wide field of view due to their eyes being positioned on the sides of their heads. This allows them to detect predators from different angles. They also have highly sensitive hearing, which helps them detect approaching threats.</div>
        <div class="col-md-3"><h5>Nocturnal and Crepuscular: </h5>While domestic rabbits can adjust their activity patterns to match human schedules, wild rabbits are typically crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk. This behavior helps them avoid predators that are active during the day or night.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-3"><h5>Thumping:</h5>When rabbits sense danger, they may thump their hind feet on the ground as a warning signal to other rabbits in the area. This behavior is especially common in wild rabbits but can also be observed in domestic rabbits.</div>
        <div class="col-md-3"><h5>Grooming:</h5> Rabbits are fastidious groomers and spend a significant amount of time grooming themselves to keep their fur clean and free of parasites. They also engage in social grooming, where they groom each other as a form of bonding behavior.</div>
        <div class="col-md-3"><h5>Longevity:</h5>In the wild, rabbits typically have shorter lifespans due to predation and environmental factors. However, domestic rabbits can live for 8 to 12 years or even longer with proper care and nutrition.</div>
        <div class="col-md-3"><h5>Symbolism: </h5>Rabbits have been depicted symbolically in various cultures and mythologies. In some traditions, they represent fertility, luck, and abundance, while in others, they symbolize trickery and cunning</div>
